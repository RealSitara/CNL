1. Demonstrate the different types of topologies and types of transmission media by using a packet tracer tool:
            1. Star Topology
            2. Ring Topology
            3. Bus Topology
            4. Mesh Topology

2. Setup a WAN which contains wired as well as wireless LAN by using a packet tracer tool. Demonstrate transfer of a packet from LAN 1 (wired LAN) to LAN2 (Wireless LAN).

3. Use packet Tracer tool for configuration of 3 router networks using one of the following protocols RIP/OSPF/BGP.

4. Write a program to demonstrate Sub-netting and find subnet masks.

5. Socket Programming using C/C++/Java. TCP Client, TCP Server

6. Socket Programming using C/C++/Java. UDP Client, UDP Server

7. Write a program using TCP socket for wired network for following Say Hello to Each other

8. Write a program using TCP socket for wired network for following File transfer

9. Write a program using UDP Sockets to enable file transfer.

10. To study the SSL protocol by capturing the packets using Wireshark tool while visiting any SSL secured website (banking, e-commerce etc.).

11. Study and Analyze the performance HTTP & FTP protocol

12. Installing and configuring DHCP server and assign IP addresses to client machines using DHCP server using Cisco packet tracer

13. Write a program for DNS lookup. Given an IP address input, it should
return URL and viceversa


14. Capture packets using Wireshark and accomplish the following andsave the output in file:
    1. Capture all TCP traffic to/from Facebook, during the time when you log in to your Facebook account
    2. Capture all HTTP traffic to/from Facebook (other website), when you log in to your Facebook account
    3. Write a DISPLAY filter expression to count all TCP packets (captured under item #1) that have the flags SYN, PSH, and RST set. Show the fraction of packets that had each flag set.
    4. Count how many TCP packets you received from / sent to Facebook (other website), and how many of each were also HTTP packets.
